         <p>A hidden escape where the night hums with the sounds of jazz and the clink of lowball glasses. Inspired by the timeless elegance of midnight rendezvous and the soul of a bygone era, Nocturne is more than a bar—it’s an experience.</p>
         <p>Tucked away behind an unassuming entrance, Nocturne pays homage to the clandestine spirit of the Prohibition era, when the best nights were found in hidden rooms and whispered invitations. During the 1920s, speakeasies flourished as sanctuaries for those who sought more than just a drink—they sought artistry, atmosphere, and escape. Here, that tradition lives on.</p>
         <p>With a menu rooted in classic mixology, each cocktail is crafted with precision and reverence for the past. From the velvety smoothness of an Old Fashioned to the bright complexity of a French 75, our bartenders honor time-tested recipes while infusing them with a touch of modern alchemy. Live jazz drifts through the dimly lit space, setting the stage for nights that unfold like a melody—rich, layered, and unforgettable.</p>
         <p>Whether you arrive by chance or follow the whispers, Nocturne is a place to disappear into the night and rediscover the magic of the moment.</p>
         <p>Find your way back.</p>
